## About the Project

EconoMe was a challenging project that allowed me to hone in on my clean coding skills and problem-solving abilities. As the project grew larger, I had to manage connections between many features and ensure that each component of the game worked together seamlessly. In particular, implementing the procedural terrain generation and mob AI using state machines were complex tasks that required careful planning and testing.

The extensive inventory system utilizing API connections was another challenging feature to implement, but it greatly enhanced the gameplay experience. Players can trade goods and services with each other using an in-game marketplace that connects to external APIs.

Finally, the custom starting screen and world time cycle add to the immersion of the game and make it more enjoyable to play.
